    The NetBug intention is to provide a decentralized bug database.
    Currently each of the bug tracking system is independent and cannot
    cooperate easily with the other systems. As a result the bug can be spread
    across many bug tracking systems - for example in the distribution and 
    projects.

    The protocol is based on a REST and XML. But the implementation is free to
    provide other formats (such as HTML, XHTML or JSON) if they are
    requested by client.
